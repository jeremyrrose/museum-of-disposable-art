# MoDA

## Description
MoDA is a demonstration front-end layout for an as-yet-hypothetical CMS, including three template pages: a home page, a category list, and a story page. The menu displays different behavior for tablet and mobile viewers.

There is no content, but if there were, it might look quite lovely in this.
